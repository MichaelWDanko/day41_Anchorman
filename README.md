Anchorman is a newsfeed app that utilizes the framework of AngularJS.

The app contains three seperate views:
- Main Feed
  - Shows the most recent articles, their titles, publisher, and time published
  - Lets the user save the article for later, and sends a copy of it to the Saved view
  - A banner denotes which articles could be of interest to the user, which is set by the user in the Interests view
- Interests
  - Lets the user create a list of interests that are used to mark the Main Feed's articles
  - Interests can be added or deleted to the list at any time
  - Interests are not case sensitive. An interest will be altered to display correctly. 
- Saved
  - Lists the user's saved articles
